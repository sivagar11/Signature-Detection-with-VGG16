# Signature-Detection-with-VGG16

This project involves training a VGG16 model for signature detection and using the trained model for predicting signatures in images.

# Overview
The aim of this project is to detect signatures within images using deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. The trained model will identify and locate signatures within provided images.

# Customization

Adjust the training script to fit your dataset structure and classes.

Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

Modify the signature prediction script to integrate with your application or system.
